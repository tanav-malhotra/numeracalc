# numeracalc
An easy to use CLI tool to calculate the values of words according to Numerology that I made for a friend.

### Type these commands (either in the terminal for macOS and Linux, or Powershell for Windows):
- Install Rust if you haven't already (on macOS and Linux only, Windows go [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)):
```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

cargo install numeracalc
```
